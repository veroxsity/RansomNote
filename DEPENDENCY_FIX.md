# Dependency Resolution Fix

## Issue
Frontend `npm install` failed with peer dependency conflict:
```
@mantine/core@7.17.8 requires @mantine/hooks@7.17.8
but package.json had @mantine/hooks@8.3.5
```

## Root Cause
The previous developer added Mantine UI library dependencies but:
1. Never actually used Mantine in the code (app uses Tailwind CSS)
2. Had mismatched versions causing peer dependency conflicts
3. Also included unused drag-and-drop libraries

## Solution
Removed all unused dependencies from `frontend/package.json`:
- ❌ `@mantine/core` (unused)
- ❌ `@mantine/hooks` (unused)
- ❌ `@mantine/next` (unused)
- ❌ `@dnd-kit/*` packages (unused)
- ❌ `react-dnd` (unused)
- ❌ `react-dnd-html5-backend` (unused)
- ❌ `react-use` (unused)

## Final Dependencies

### Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)
```json
"dependencies": {
  "next": "14.0.0",
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "18.2.0",
  "socket.io-client": "^4.8.1"
}
```

All UI is built with:
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- ✅ Native React hooks (for state management)
- ✅ Socket.IO client (for real-time communication)

### Backend (`backend/package.json`)
No changes needed - already working correctly.

## Verification
Both services start successfully:
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3001 (NestJS + Socket.IO)
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Next.js 14)
- ✅ All socket event handlers registered
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No dependency conflicts

## Next Steps
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to test the game!
